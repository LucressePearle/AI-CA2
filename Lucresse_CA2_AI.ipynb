    "### (i)The differences between a graph and a tree \n",
    "  A graph being a collection of vertices and edges, the edge is the connection between 02 vertices. A tree could be identify as a specific type of graph that is connected and contents no cycles. \n",
    " This are some main differents between a graph and a Tree:  \n",
    "###### Graph:\n",
    "- Can content loops, or can be connected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The edges can be directed or undirected.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Do not have a specific root not.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- A node do not have a limited number of connections to other nodes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- A graph can get very complex the more nodes and edges are added into it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Traversal techniques use are Breath and depth first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Tree:\n",
    "   - It is acyclic.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Has a unique path between two vertices.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Has a root, which is the starting point of tree.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Usually look like hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - A node except from the root node has a maximum of one parent.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Traversal techniques used are pre-order, in-order , post-order.\n",

    "### (iii) The advantages of using a Graph Visualisation\n",
    "   A graph as a visualisation can be consider as a virtual reprensation of a real life problem. This visualisation is often use to reprensent problems because graphs are easy ways to represent connections and can mathematicaly analyze these connexions.\n",
    "   In our case of study a graph is being use to visualize the different ways  we can get to an end solution(S) in a puzzle, These are some advantages of using graph as visualizations of our problem:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - In our case, using a graph will help visualise the problem better, by showing all the different connexion or possible path to complete the puzzle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The implementation of a graph and the use of the traversal techniques of a graph could helps us get to our end point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The graph represents all the possible path to get to the end point, therefore giving us the ability to choose the best path.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Graph gives us more insights of the problem, improving therefore our understanding of the problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Graphs helps in making analysis and for data processing through the use of their algorithms and theories.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Graphs are also use to reduce computation flow."
